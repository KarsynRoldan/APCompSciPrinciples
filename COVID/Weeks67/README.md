# Weeks 6 & 7: May 10 thru May 22

## Introduction

Over the next few weeks you should be wrapping up your Create Task. Although it isn't due to College Board until May 26, **if you would like your Create Task to count towards your semester 2 grade, you must submit your portfolio by May 22 to College Board.**  In this lesson I will provide you some resources on wrapping up your Create Task and submitting your porfolio.
